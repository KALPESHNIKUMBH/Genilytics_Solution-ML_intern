#Q3.2
# Define the observed number of "successes" (heads to the right)
observed_successes <- 80

# Define the total number of trials (kissing pairs)
total_trials <- 124

# Perform the binomial test
binom.test(observed_successes, total_trials, p = 0.5, alternative = "two.sided")

#Q3.4
# Given data
n_right_handed <- 83  # Number of right-handed people
n_left_handed <- 17   # Number of left-handed people
n_right_head_turn <- 80  # Number of people who turn their heads to the right

# Calculate sample proportions
p_right_handed <- n_right_handed / (n_right_handed + n_left_handed)
p_right_head_turn <- n_right_head_turn / (n_right_handed + n_left_handed)

# Perform the hypothesis test
prop.test(x = c(n_right_head_turn, n_right_handed), n = c(n_right_handed + n_left_handed, n_right_handed + n_left_handed), alternative = "two.sided")
